hello-world, my name is Vincent. I am currently a student hoping to become a web designer. I tend to catch on quickly to HTML and CSS, however strugle a bit with javascript. I also notice that while classes are so specific, it is sometimes an entire semester or 2 before I ever touch a specific code language. I've noticed that I do not necessarily remember specifics when it comes to certain code if it takes that long before using that code again, therefore, I researched the best ways to stay on top of my coding and proficiency and github was recommended. I'm hoping to meet individuals that can also help me along my journey.
